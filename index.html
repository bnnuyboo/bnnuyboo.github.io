                    Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney is a visual novel adventure video games franchise developed and
                    published by Capcom, and written by Shu Takumi. The first game was released in 2001, with many
                    other additions to the franchise being released throughout the years, such as sequels to the
                    main story, spin-offs and prequels, as well as anime, movie adaptations and many more that make
                    the Ace Attorney universe so vast and special. <br />
                    The main trilogy of Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney focuses its story on the journey of the titular
                    character Phoenix Wright, a rookie defense attorney who just begun his career. He is accompanied
                    by Mia Fey, his mentor and friend, as well as genius prosecutor Miles Edgeworth, medium in training
                    Maya Fey and many other characters. <br />
                    Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney has a storytelling reminiscent of legal dramas, with each chapter
                    featuring a murder mystery, an investigation and a trial to defend Phoenix's client and find out who
                    the real culprit is. The story also expands upon the main characters motivations and troubles, bringing
                    out the best (and sometimes worst) in each of them.

                            In the first game of the franchise, you get in the shoes of Phoenix Wright, a rookie defense attorney
                            who's just beggining his career under the tutelage of his boss and friend Mia Fey. As the first game in
                            the line, it also introduces the whole universe of Ace Attorney, as well as the main characters that will
                            appear throughout the entire franchise, such as genius prosecutor, Miles Edgeworth, and the medium in
                            training and Mia's little sister, Maya Fey. This game focuses primarily in establishing the characters
                            relationships and backstories, as well as solving some disputes between them.

                            The second game of the main trilogy, Justice for All, serves as a continuation for the events
                            of the first game, featuring Phoenix Wright on the peak of his career, not having lost a single
                            case since he started acting as a defense attorney. Naturally, the game's main plot puts his pride
                            as an attorney to the test, as well as his desire to protect the wrongfully accused. This game also
                            has a few additions to the cast, like revenge-seeking prodigy, Franziska von Karma, and the adorable
                            medium prodigy, and Maya's cousin, Pearl Fey. This game introduces a whole new game mechanic and
                            focuses primarily on building Phoenix's character, as well as concluding other characters' plotlines.

                            The third and last game of the main trilogy, Trials and Tribulations is the (intended) finale for
                            the main characters' stories and plots, tying it all around with a nice ribbon. In it's prologue,
                            it features, suprisingly, Mia Fey on the start of her career, explaining a lot about her past and
                            the past of the main characters, and how they all tie together with the entire plot of the game. As
                            such, this game's main plot focuses a lot on the past and the idea of fate, and how everything, one
                            way or another, must come to an end. While bringing back some familiar faces from the first two games,
                            Trials and Tribulations, just like the previous two games, introduces new characters for the overall
                            plot, like mysterious masked prosecutor, Godot, and Dahlia Hawthorne, Phoenix's ex-girlfriend. This
                            game is considered to be the best game in the trilogy, and in the entire franchise altogether.
