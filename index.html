                    Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney is a visual novel adventure video games franchise developed and
                    published by Capcom, and written by Shu Takumi. The first game was released in 2001, with many
                    other additions to the franchise being released throughout the years, such as sequels to the
                    main story, spin-offs and prequels, as well as anime, movie adaptations and many more that make
                    the Ace Attorney universe so vast and special.
                    The main trilogy of Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney focuses its story on the journey of the titular
                    character Phoenix Wright, a rookie defense attorney who just begun his career. He is accompanied
                    by Mia Fey, his mentor and friend, as well as genius prosecutor Miles Edgeworth, medium in training
                    Maya Fey and many other characters.
                    Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney has a storytelling reminiscent of legal dramas, with each chapter
                    featuring a murder mystery, an investigation and a trial to defend Phoenix's client and find out who
                    the real culprit is. The story also expands upon the main characters motivations and troubles, bringing
                    out the best (and sometimes worst) in each of them.
